# MarcNettlesWebsite

This was code I started for a school project to be put on Heroku. We swapped over to another student's github repo, so this one is incomplete. We had the site up temporarily on Heroku.
My own personal website. Bootstrap HTML, CSS, EJS front end with NodeJS, jQuery, PostgreSQL backend. Hosted on Heroku.
